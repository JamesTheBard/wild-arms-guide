# Introduction

This is a quick-and-dirty site built to house information about Wild Arms.  I started working on merging a few sources of information about the game along with adding some basic overviews of maps to create an easy-to-follow guide with enough information to be dangerous.

I'll try to keep it organized, but I want to capture the various bits of tech required, maps showing the current route, and other bits that tend to be lost with the sands of time.  Might even break down the save game structure as it would fit in perfectly.

The current target is the _Any% No ACE_ run, but if I can find the time, I'll try to add the other runs.
