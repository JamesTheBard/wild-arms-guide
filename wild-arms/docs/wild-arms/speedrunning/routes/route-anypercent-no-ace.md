# Any% No ACE

This is a combination of two route documents and the Wild Arms US Any% No ACE speedrun by cha0sCord.  If you see information in here, it's 99% certain that it has come from those documents or the speedrun video.

## Setup

:::info
After setting all of this up, simply kill your character or start a new game (do not reset).  The settings will carry over to a new game.  Probably wouldn't hurt to create a save game slot with all of these settings.
:::

### Game Configuration

Since there will be a ton of mashing, it's _highly_ recommended to map **Accept** to an additional button: specifically **R1**.

<Figure caption="Controller Configuration Screen" src="/img/wild-arms/route/accept_button_mapping.jpg" />

### Camera Configuration

Ensure that the camera is configured for **Quarter View** to prevent the camera from rotating during combat.

<Figure caption="Camera Configuration Screen" src="/img/wild-arms/route/camera_quarter_view.jpg" />

### Cursor Configuration

Ensure that the cursor is configured to stay where it was last selected in a menu via the **Memory** setting.

<Figure caption="Cursor Configuration Screen" src="/img/wild-arms/route/cursor_memory_setting.jpg" />

### Auto-Fire/Turbo

#### MiSTer Configuration

To enable auto-fire on a given button, press the button and while holding tap the OSD menu button on the controller.  You can also increase/decrease the rate by pressing left/right or up/down on the controller and tapping the OSD menu button on the controller.

:::warning
Using turbo/auto-fire functionality may disqualify the speedrun from being valid or accepted.  Use at your own risk.

## Rudy's Prologue

### Surf Village

#### Objectives

1. Spell your name correctly (**R**)
2. Get **Bombs** from the Mayor
3. Get out of town and go to _Berry Cave_

#### Tech

:::tip Tech: Double Dash
Holding down **Circle** will cause a character to dash after a small charge time, but tapping **Circle** once and then holding it down will eliminate the charge.  Faster in most cases.
:::

:::tip Tech: Dash Drifting
Advanced movement technique that you don't immediately need to know.  A better explanation of this [technique is here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f80ifnKz1Hc9gJlcTUeCerlXwqS5yl8Yl99cO_GczbE/edit?usp=sharing).
:::

#### Walkthrough

<Figure caption="Surf Village" src="/img/wild-arms/maps/Surf Village (Wild Arms)@0.5x.jpg" />

You're here to work, and your pay: a **Heal Berry**.  Since there are far better fortunes available outside of _Surf Village_, let's get to the mayor's house quickly (the building with the save birb), talk to him, and realize that little Timmy fell down a well (_Berry Cave_).

So, get your bombs and head south.

### Berry Cave

#### Objectives

1. Avoid the curse trigger on **Bat Bridge** in _Room 4_
1. Run away from all the things
1. **Apples** in the hidden area in _Room 4_
1. **Bandana** on the left-hand side of the _Final Room_

#### Escape Rates (Luck-based)

| Monster | BAD | NORMAL | GOOD |
|----------------------|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Balloon x1           | 45% | 55% | 65% |
| Balloon x2           | 45% | 55% | 65% |
| Balloon + Goblin     | 45% | 55% | 65% |
| Goblin x2            | 40% | 50% | 60% |
| Balloon + Tatzelbelm | 45% | 55% | 65% |
| Tatzelbelm           | 40% | 50% | 60% |

#### Walkthrough

<Figure caption="Berry Cave, Rooms 1 and 2" src="/img/wild-arms/maps/Berry Cave (Wild Arms) - Rooms 1 and 2@0.5x.jpg" />

In _Room 1_, head north, then in _Room 2_ continue quickly from the entrance all the way to the exit.  The standard rule for battles: run away.  The standard rule for moving: run quickly.

<Figure caption="Berry Cave, Room 3" src="/img/wild-arms/maps/Berry Cave (Wild Arms) - Room 3@0.5x.jpg" />

In _Room 3_, pull the lever, wait for the statue, then book it south.  You only need to destroy the southern-most box, and avoid anything that could be considered _shiny_.  Basically, its south, then east, then north.  The final puzzle in the room is: blow up crate, pull lever, continue north.

<Figure caption="Berry Cave, Room 4" src="/img/wild-arms/maps/Berry Cave (Wild Arms) - Room 4@0.5x.jpg" />

In _Room 4_, head southeast.  Beware as there is a curse trigger about 75% of the way down that will trigger if you run across it, so it's recommended that you slow down before crossing it.  Conveniently, it's also marked on the map.

After heading north and then southwest, you'll notice a suspiciously opening-shaped obstruction that would be perfectly fixed with a **Bomb**.  This is the entrance to the hidden area holding the **Hardy Apple**, **Agile Apple**, and **Power Apple** items.  Grab all of these.

From there, head south to the final puzzle: left lever first, right lever second, fleeing south third into the _Save Room_.

<Figure caption="Berry Cave, Save Room" src="/img/wild-arms/maps/Berry Cave (Wild Arms) - Save Room@0.5x.jpg" />

You don't need anything here other than going fast.  

:::caution Safe Strats
There is a **Bullet Clip** in the chest if you don't feel like gambling.
:::

<Figure caption="Berry Cave, Final Room" src="/img/wild-arms/maps/Berry Cave (Wild Arms) - Final Room@0.5x.jpg" />

Head north, grab the **Bandana** in the chest on the right, then talk to the obelisk to get to the boss battle.

#### Boss Battle (Zombie)

:::tip Tech: Double Tap
With **X** and **R1** bound to _Accept_, you can go through battle menus quicker by tapping one after the other repeatedly.  Menus are responsive enough that holding **Up** as soon as get to Rudy's combat menu and double tapping will use **Hand Cannon** on _Zombie_.  If, however, you don't press **Up** at the right time, you'll use a regular attack instead.
:::

**HP**: 800

| Attack | Description |
|:------:|-------------|
| Special (Rotten Breath) | 20% of max HP (15 damage at level 1) |
| Normal | 15 dmg (reduced to 14 with the **Bandana**) |

Basic rules: if **HP > 30**, then _Hand Cannon_.  Else _Heal Berry_.

**Bandana** gives you an extra turn to attack assuming the _Zombie_ does a regular attack at least once.  Ideally you should only have to heal once, but this will often lead to runs dying to _Zombie_.  Use **Lock-on** force power if you want to avoid missing when possible.

:::warning
Will lose the _Zombie_ battle if two bullets from the **Hand Cannon** miss, if the _Zombie_ doesn't use a regular attack in the first five turns, or not enough extra damage is dealt.
:::

After _Zombie_ dies, mash through all of the dialog, endure the slings and arrows of the village, and finish up Rudy's prologue with a quickness to move on to Jack's prologue next.

## Jack's Prologue

### Memory Temple

#### Objectives

- Fight first _Skeleton_ you encounter to get to Level 2
- Leave _Memory Temple_ and get your ass to _Aldehyde_

#### Escape Rates

| Monster | BAD | NORMAL | GOOD |
|--------------------|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Balloon            | 45% | 55% | 65% |
| Balloon x2         | 45% | 55% | 65% |
| Balloon + Pillbug  | 45% | 55% | 65% |
| Pillbug x2         | 40% | 50% | 60% |
| Pillbug + Skeleton | 40% | 50% | 60% |
| Skeleton           | 40% | 50% | 60% |

#### Walkthrough

<Figure caption="Memory Temple, Rooms 1 through 3" src="/img/wild-arms/maps/Memory Temple (Wild Arms) - Rooms 1 through 3@0.5x.jpg" />

After the intro in _Room 1_, head south, east, then north.  Navigate around the pit, quickly throw Hanpan at the trigger, then back around the pit, west, and north into the door.

In _Room 2_, move the middle block and sprint south into the left door at the bottom of the room.

In _Room 3_, throw Hanpan at a diagonal to open the portcullis and head through the newly-opened door.

<Figure caption="Memory Temple, Rooms 4, 5, and Save Room (Bottom, Right, Left)" src="/img/wild-arms/maps/Memory Temple (Wild Arms) - Rooms 4, 5, and Save Room@0.5x.jpg" />

In _Room 4_, head east via dashing, then north into _Room 5_. Make an "S"-shaped pattern to eventually throw Hanpan at the trigger from the diagonal.  Once that's done, throw yourself off the ledge to get back to the room's opening, then head south to get back into _Room 4_.

From here, head west all the way to the otherside of the hall, then north into the _Save Room_.  Then, head south out of the _Save Room_.

:::caution Safe Strats
You can use a **Heal Berry** at this point, and save if you want as there is a chance of dying to a _Skeleton_ + _Pillbug_ ambush
:::

<Figure caption="Memory Temple, Rooms 6, 7, and Teleport Room (Left, Top Right, Bottom Right)" src="/img/wild-arms/maps/Memory Temple (Wild Arms) - Rooms 6, 7, and Teleport Room@0.5x.jpg" />

In a similar manner to _Room 1_, head east, north, west, then north again in _Room 6_.  In the room with two triggers, throw Hanpan diagonally twice to open the door and then proceed through that opening.

In _Room 7_, it's another "S"-shaped pattern.  Go quickly, don't worry about the spikes as you should be well past them when they trigger, and exit the room to the north.

In the _Teleport Room_, have Jack go to one side, Hanpan to the other and bail via the portal that opens in the middle of the room.  Both Jack and Hanpan have to touch the triggers at the same time to open the portal.

### Aldehyde

<Figure caption="Aldehyde" src="/img/wild-arms/maps/Aldehyde Map@0.5x.jpg" />

#### Objectives

- Get to _Aldehyde_
- Buy **Magical Rod** (x1), **White Robe** (x1), **Heal Berry** (x11), **Medicine** (x1)

#### Walkthrough

Basically, after entering _Aldehyde_, make a 45-degree angle to the shop and hit up the first vendor for the **Magical Rod** and **White Robe**.  Then, at the second vendor grab the **Heal Berry** (x11) and the **Medicine** (x1).

:::info
These are for Cecilia, but since she's not in the party you won't get the option to auto-equip as you buy them.  However, Cecilia will greatly appreciate them in the next section.
:::

After that, head over to the save birb and switch over to Cecilia.
