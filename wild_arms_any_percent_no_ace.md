# General Information

## Credit Where Credit is Due

This is a combination of two documents written by cha0sCord.  If you see information in here, it's 99% certain that it has come from that document as I'm just piecing the information together in a bit more readable format.  The goal is to get the now current route combined with all the tech.  It is definitely a work in progress.

## Game Configuration

Since there will be a ton of mashing, it's _highly_ recommended to map Accept to an additional button: specifically **R1**.

| Controller Configuration Screen |

## Camera Configuration

Ensure that the camera is configured for **Quarter View** view to prevent the camera from rotating during combat.

## Cursor Configuration

Ensure that the cursor is configured to stay where it was last selected in a menu via the **Memory** setting.

## Auto-Fire (MiSTer)

To enable auto-fire on a given button, press the button and then tap the OSD menu button on the controller.  You can also increase/decrease the rate by pressing left/right or up/down on the controller and tapping the OSD menu button on the controller.

## Character Names

The circle button (B) will delete characters quite effectively.

# Rudy's Prologue

## Surf Village

| Surf Village |

### Objectives

1. Spell your name correctly (**R**)
2. Get **Bombs** from the Mayor
3. Get out of town and go to _Berry Cave_

### Tech

:::danger
**TECH: DOUBLE DASH**
Holding down **Circle** will cause a character to dash after a small charge time, but tapping **Circle** once and then holding it down will eliminate the charge.  Faster in most cases.
:::

:::danger
**TECH: DASH DRIFTING**
Advanced movement technique that you don't immediately need to know.  A better explanation of this [technique is here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f80ifnKz1Hc9gJlcTUeCerlXwqS5yl8Yl99cO_GczbE/edit?usp=sharing).

### Points of Interest

- **Bat Bridge**: Avoid the curse trigger.  If you run over the trigger, you'll get that curse so _slow down_.

- **Apples**: Ensure you blow up the wall to get into the secret room with all the **Apples**.

- **Bandana**: There is a **Bandana** in the final room.  Get it and equip it, then heal Rudy to full health before speaking to the Monolith.  This triggers the _Zombie_ fight.

### Escape Rates (Luck-based)

| Monster | BAD | NORMAL | GOOD |
|----------------------|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Balloon x1           | 45% | 55% | 65% |
| Balloon x2           | 45% | 55% | 65% |
| Balloon + Goblin     | 45% | 55% | 65% |
| Goblin x2            | 40% | 50% | 60% |
| Balloon + Tatzelbelm | 45% | 55% | 65% |
| Tatzelbelm           | 40% | 50% | 60% |

### Zombie Fight

**HP**: 800

| Attack | Description |
|:------:|-------------|
| Special (Rotten Breath) | 20% of max HP (15 damage at level 1) |
| Normal | 15 dmg (reduced to 14 with the **Bandana**) |

Basic rules: if **HP > 30**, then _Hand Cannon_.  Else _Heal Berry_.

**Bandana** gives you an extra turn to attack assuming the _Zombie_ does a regular attack at least once.  Ideally you should only have to heal once, but this will often lead to runs dying to _Zombie_.  Use **Lock-on** force power if you want to avoid missing when possible.

:::danger
**TECH: DOUBLE TAP**
With **X** and **R1** bound to _Accept_, you can go through battle menus quicker by tapping one after the other repeatedly.  Menus are responsive enough that holding **Up** as soon as get to Rudy's combat menu and double tapping will use **Hand Cannon** on _Zombie_.  If, however, you don't press **Up** at the right time, you'll use a regular attack instead.
:::

:::warning
**WARNING**: Will lose the _Zombie_ battle if two bullets from the **Hand Cannon** miss, if the _Zombie_ doesn't use a regular attack in the first five turns, or not enough extra damage is dealt.
:::

After _Zombie_ dies, mash through all of the dialog, endure the slings and arrows of the village, and finish up Rudy's prologue with a quickness to move on to Jack's prologue next.

# Jack's Prologue

### Points of Interest

**TECH: PHANTOM SLOT**
Every slot in inventory stores two bits of information: the item ID and the associated quantity.  When the quantity is 0, the slot appears empty.  However, the item ID is still associated with the slot.

There are two ways of creating a _Phantom Slot_: by using all of the items in a given slot, or by moving an item to a certain slot then using the _Re-Arrange_ inventory sorting option to sort all of your items.  The slot you moved the item into will be the _Phantom Slot_.
:::

### Walkthrough

1. Talk to the Librarian
1. Grab **Mystic Apple** from kitchen
1. Get **Pocket Watch** from Anne
1. Get **Crest Graph** from Instructor, move to Slot `7L` in inventory
1. Talk to Librarian again
1. Talk to mysterious book
1. Talk to Sister Mary
1. Talk to Hallway Student
1. Go to Spellbinding Room:
    - **Unbind**: Flame (Black Fray/Fray), Heal (White Muse/Muse)
    - **Bind**: Freeze (Black Muse/Muse), Valkyrie (Black Wing/Geo), Spark (Black Wing/Muse)
      :::warning
      **NOTE**: This will setup the _Phantom Slot_ for the **Crest Graph**.
      :::
1. **Pocket Watch** to start of room
1. Flip switch on back of statues
1. **Tear Drop** between statues
1. **Tear Drop** into Sealed Library

## Sealed Library

### Points of Interest

- **Magic Carrot**: In the fourth room, pick up the top-most chest to get a **Magic Carrot**.  Also, throw the box beside the chest directly down to hit the switch.
- **Capuche**: Pick up the **Capuche** on the right side of the main room.
- **Three Books**: Burn them.

### Walkthrough

Try to get Level two (2-3 encounters). Unlike the previous two dungeons, you want to fight encounters unless there is no hope of getting Level 2.  Level 2 requires 40 XP with books giving 6 XP each, and Gagisons giving 4 XP.

The first battle you get into, go to _Equipment_ in the top-most battle menu and **Equip Optimal** on Cecilia.  If the fist is a single Blue Book, regular attacks to kill, otherwise use **Valkyrie**.

In the final room, equip **Capuche** and heal Cecilia up.  Set up the inventory in the following way.  Important thing is setting up _Phantom Slots_ for **Apples** and **Magic Carrot**.

| Row | Left         | Right |
|:---:|:------------:|:-----:|
| 7   | Crest Graph* | Magic Carrot |
| 8   |              | Mystic Apple |
| 9   |              | Hardy Apple  |
| 10  |              | Agile Apple  |
| 11  |              | Power Apple  |

If you've cast any spells, use the **Magic Carrot**.  Even if you _didn't_ cast any spells, re-arrange all of the slots to setup the _Phantom Slots_.

Now talk to the Mysterious Book.

### Escape Rates

| Monster | Exp | BAD | NORMAL | GOOD |

| Blue Book              | 6 XP  | 40% | 50% | 60% |
| Blue Book x2           | 12 XP | 40% | 50% | 60% |
| Blue Book x3           | 18 XP | 40% | 50% | 60% |

| Blue Book x2 + Gagison | 16 XP | 40% | 50% | 60% |
| Blue Book + Gagison x2 | 14 XP | 40% | 50% | 60% |

### Nelgaul

**HP**: 300

| Attack | Description |
|:-:|:--|
| Special (Brutal Attack) | 12 dmg (at Level 1) |
| Regular | 9 dmg (at Level 1) |

#### Strats

- Level 1: If **HP** > 24 and _Nelgaul_ HP < 37, **Freeze**. Otherwise **Heal Berry**.
- Level 2: Go to _Auto Battle_ in the top-most combat menu and set _Auto Battle_ to **All Out**.  Battle will play out automatically until you press **X** where you'll be given a change to turn off _Auto Battle_.  Should survive the fight without having to cancel _Auto Battle_, only a slight chance of dying horribly.
- Level 2 (ADV): Same as above, but return to _Manual_ and use **Valkyrie** x2 or **Valkyrie** + **Freeze** if the first **Valkyrie** did 80 damage.

When _Nelgaul_ dies, you will receive the **Water Rune** (must account for this when setting up _Phantom Slots_) and get bounced out to _Curan Abbey_.  

Head to the southern part of the abbey and swap out a few spells for some new spells at the Spellbinder:
- **Unbind**: Spark (Black Wing/Muse), Freeze (Black Muse/Muse)
- **Bind**: Escape (White Wing/Fray), Sleep (Black Geo/Wing)

Exit the abbey to get a gray screen and the character select.   On character select, move cursor to **Pocket Watch** tool and hit _Accept_ on Cecilia.

Take Cecilia to Aldehyde.

## Aldehyde

Talk to Emma in her workshop, mash _Accept_ as there is a _Yes_ prompt.  **Pocket Watch** when the dialog is complete, and talk to _Jack_ by the memory bird to recruit him.

:::info
**SAFE STRATS:** There is a small chance of dying in _Lolithia's Tomb_ so the safe strat is to save here.
:::

## Lolithia's Tomb

### Tech

:::danger
**TECH: CHARACTER SWITCH OOB**
Move your character 1 pixel away from the load zone of a door facing downwards, charge your dash, and on the first frame of movement open the character switch menu and switch to a different character that is in your current party.
:::

:::danger
**TECH: SAME ROOM OOB**
The simplest of the three is _Same Room_ where you simply re-enter the room you went OOB in.  Only nuance of this is that you can only re-enter rooms from the left and/or top side of the screen (or from a downward facing door, but that's usually where you went OOB in the first place so _what's wrong with you_).
:::

:::danger
**TECH: SAME MAP OOB**
When you enter a dungeon, all of its rooms are loaded into a large map.  You are prevented from seeing the rooms adjacent to the one you are currently in because the camera is locked to the room.  Additionally, if a door isn't on screen, you cannot go through it.  This prevents going OOB and blindly going throught the final door in a dungeon.  The exception to this is if the room directly above your current room has a downward facing door as the load zone is so close to being on camera that the game actually thinks it is.

**Same Map** is just going OOB and then going through the load zone of that door, advancing to a room potentially much later in the dungeon.
:::

:::danger
**TECH: ADVANCED ITEM DUPLICATION**
While in battle, use a **Heal Berry** (or any consumable) with your first character, and have the second character switch the **Heal Berry** slot with a _Phantom Slot_.  This will underflow the _Phantom Slot_ by one rolling it over to 255 items.  The negation only happens when the **Heal Berry** is actually used, so if the battle ends prior to usage, the duplication will not happen.  The _Phantom Slot_ will still exist, it will just be in the item slot that your **Heal Berries** were in previously.  Unless you got an item from the fight, then there's a chance it was overwritten.
:::

### Walkthrough

Going through _Lolithia's Tomb_, you should get 2-3 encounters.  You should have _Phantom Slots_ setup for each type of **Apple**, **Magic Carrot**, and **Crest Graph**.  The end goal: having everything duped during the first encounter.

When the items have been duped, use:

  | Target | Item | Stop At |
  |:-:|---|:-:|
  | Cecilia | **Mystic Apple** | 2 |
  | Cecilia | **Hardy Apple** | 100 |
  | Jack | **Hard Apple** | 2 |
  | Cecilia | **Power Apple** | 2 |
  | Cecilia | **Agile Apple** | 105 |
  | Jack | **Agile Apple** | 2
  
#### Individual Encounter Strats

:::warning
**NOTE**: _Rat Monkeys_ and _Turkeys_ are immune to **Sleep**, don't bother using it on them.
:::

| Encounter | Description |
|---|---|
| Rat Monkeys x3 | Can kill with counter attacks, so focus on duping.  If there's no need to dupe, **Valkyrie** to kill all, regular attack if there's only one left |
| Pillbugs x4 | Good chance of running away, so focus on duping.  Run away if you don't need to dupe. |
| Tatzelbelms x3 | Won't die to counter attack, so use **Freeze** at the start of battle to make turns shorter.  If you get all **Apples** duped, **Freeze** again (if there are two remaining).  Run away if you don't need to dupe. |
| Rat Monkeys x3, Turkey x1 | Dangerous fight.  While duping, _Jack_ should use **Heal Berry** on _Cecilia_ if both characters are at full HP, otherwise heal whoever is closer to death.  **Valkyrie** has a chance of taking out a couple of _Rat Monkeys_, and a regular attack from _Cecilia_ will take out one.  Get the enemies down to just the _Turkey_, then kill the _Turkey_ if done with duping.  If you get this fight after you're finished duping, just **Valkyrie** and regular attack with _Jack_ to hopefully kill them all. |
| Turkey x2 | Same deal as above, except use **Freeze** x2 to take out one of the _Turkeys_, and then dupe.  If you get this fight after finishing duping, just **Valkyrie** |

#### Same Room OOB #1

From the entrance, go north once to enter the _Guard Room_.  To get past the guards, do a Character Switch OOB and Same Room to the other side of them.  The image below shows the position you need to be in for the OOB to work.  Once past the guards, go through the big door and through the next hallway.

| Movement for Character Switch OOB (image by cha0sCord) |

#### Same Room OOB #2

This is the first OOB with a door frame.  In most tilesets, you can tell when you are 1 pixel away from a door load zone by the fact that your character's feet will be cut off by the door frame.  Same room to be past the purple spikes on the left side of the room.  Go through the door immediately north of the purple spikes.

#### Same Map OOB

Same as before, use feet being cut off as the indicator for OOB position.  In addition to the same map here, there is a staircase off-screen that will change the floor the game thinkgs you are on, and will prevent you from continuing.  Bonk off the right side of the room to ensure that you won't go up the stairs.  The location of the Same Map door and stairway is shown below.  After the Same Map, run upwards to the boss room.

#### Past the Fun Tech

In the Bozz Room, do the puzzle (line up the boxes), go up the stairs, and get ready to fight _Magtortous_.

### Magtortous

**HP**: 2000

He has attacks, but they don't matter as you have consumed copious amounts of the forbidden fruit.  If you haven't completed duping, have _Cecilia_ guard and use those turns to do the remaining dupes.

Go into the _Equip_ menu and equip _Cecilia_ with the **Water Rune**.  Use **Valkyrie** to kill.

Afterwards, continue north to find _Lolithia_.  After the cutscene, cast **Escape**, track down _Emma_ and start heading back to _Aldehyde_.

## Aldehyde

Rest at the inn to have _Cecilia_ leave the party.  This activates a bunch of stuff.


### Tech

:::danger
**TECH: SWITCH ANYWHERE**
The game tells you that you can no longer switch to _Cecilia_, only to _Jack_ and _Rudy_.  _Rudy_ never joined the party though, so you can now switch between two separate parties at any time.
:::

:::danger
**TECH: CAMERA SWITCH**
If you have two or more separate parties, you can switch between the two parties and force the game to reevaluate where a given party is located in a dungeon.  If _Cecilia_ goes OOB in the first room of a dungeon and walks to the final room, she cannot interact with anything because the camera is still locked to the first room.  But if she then switches to _Rudy_ and back to her, the game will see that she is standing in the final room and lock the camera to the final room instead.
:::

### Walkthrough

Have _Jack_ go to the fair and buy **Small Flower** x8 (12 if being super safe), then talk to the Mom.  Return to _Aldehyde_ proper and talk to the kid with the red balloon to start the invasion.

Head north and fight the mobs surrounding _Cecilia_ (regular attacks).  After the fight, _Cecilia_ will join the party meaning that it is time for _Beselk Skip_!  Line up your pixels as shown below (You can switch to and from _Rudy_) to get rid of the fire and other effects to make things easier.
